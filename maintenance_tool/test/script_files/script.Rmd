  title: "Updating carbon use efficiency parameters"

  description: |
    This analysis involves a GLM to estimate parameters for
    temperature-dependent microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE)
    that does not predict CUE out of bound (stays between 0 and 1).
    It also updates the soil constant --- currently the one we use
    originates from a rice paddy study in the US, which is too
    narrow. The data used here is a global dataset. I re-analysed the
    dataset using a GLM, because the original study used a Gaussian
    regression. See the output html file for more details.

    The Bayesian model takes a few minutes to run, grab a cuppa! If the setup
    works as intended, then the model will only run once unless you make changes.
