#| title: Estimating deadwood stocks from SAFE data
#|
#| description: |
#|     This R script estimates deadwood litter stocks (kg C/m2) from SAFE data.
#|     It does through a few hoops: first estimate deadwood count per area, then
#|     estimate deadwood volume distribution, then deadwood density distribution,
#|     and then combine their expected value with deadwood carbon content from
#|     a global study to get deadwood stock.

#| usage_notes: |
#|   There is also deadwood density from https://zenodo.org/records/1237722 but
#|   their densities seems too low? They were in the range around ~0.2 g/cm3
